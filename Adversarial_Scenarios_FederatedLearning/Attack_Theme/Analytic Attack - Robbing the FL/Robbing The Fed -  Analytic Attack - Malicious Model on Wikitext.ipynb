This example deviates from the other \"honest-but-curious\" server models and investigates an actively malicious model. As such, the attack applies to any model architecture, but its impact is more or less obvious (or not at all) depending on the already present architecture onto which the malicious \"Imprint\" block is grafted.\n",

    "In this notebook, we place the block in front of a transformer model, as an example.

    "### Abstract:\n",
    "Federated learning has quickly gained popularity with its promises of increased user privacy and efficiency.  Previous works have shown that federated gradient updates contain information that can be used to approximately recover user data in some situations.  These previous attacks on user privacy have been limited in scope and do not scale to gradient updates aggregated over even a handful of  data  points,  leaving  some  to  conclude  that  data  privacy  is  still  intact  for realistic training regimes.  In this work, we introduce a new threat model based on minimal but malicious modifications of the shared model architecture which enable the server to directly obtain a verbatim copy of user data from gradient updates without solving difficult inverse problems.  Even user data aggregated over large batches – where previous methods fail to extract meaningful content – can be reconstructed by these minimally modified models."

      " masonry was used instead. The Arkansas Gazette referred to the structure as \" A splendid specimen of masonry \". \n",
      " For several years the arsenal, which\n",
